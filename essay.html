<h5 align="center">Racism and Injustice due to the Pigmentation of a Man’s Skin</h5>
<p class="indent"> “If you are neutral on situations of injustice, then you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” said Desmond Tutu. A Lesson Before Dying, a novel written by Ernest J. Gaines, narrates the story of a young black man, Jefferson, who was convicted and sentenced to death innocently without due process of the law. The book also illustrates the injustice and inequality blacks faced just because of the color of their skin. The story, illustrated took place in the 1940s in Lousiana, the era when Louisiana and other southern states were practicing segregation and Jim Crow laws. The preeminent theme of the book, A Lesson Before Dying, is centered on the injustice Jefferson, Grant, and the black communities faced in the confederate states.</p>
<input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-11" />

  <p class="read-more-wrap">

<i class="par"> The innocent death sentence of Jefferson clearly illustrates the cruelty of the legal injustice system in the confederate states. In the book, the white public defense attorney used derogatory and absurd racist remarks in which he described Jefferson not even as a man or a boy, but a hog. In addition, the attorney called Jefferson as nothing, but “a thing that acts on command…A thing to hold the handle of a plow, a thing to load your bales of cotton….…I would just as soon put a hog in the electric chair as this” (Defense Attorney 7).  This statement shows the mentality which the white people had about blacks, and how they saw blacks not even as fellow human beings. In addition, the court did not include a single black person to serve on the jury; as Grant said: “Twelve white men say a black man must die, and another white man sets the date and time without consulting one black person”. There was no evidence other than Jefferson was “at the wrong place at the wrong time” (Grant 152) when Mr. Grope was killed. The police did not do any sort of investigation like they would have done if it was a white man. Edwin Grimsley, a case Analyst, stated that “In the era of racial strife, the police, the prosecution, defense attorneys, judges, and jurors were always whites. Cross-racial misidentification, forced convictions, all-white juries, and blatant racism led to the wrongful conviction of countless innocent black people” (Line 6-8). So, this proves the injustice of taking black lives innocently, described by Gaines, was real and it was happening to blacks in the south. However, the injustice was not only limited to uneducated black men,but even the educated ones.</i><br>
 <span class="read-more-target">
 <i class="par">Secondly, the injustice was not only limited to uneducated blacks like Jefferson but also on Grant who was well educated. In the book, Gaines showed that whites care less even if a black man achieve the highest education, he is just another “black nigga.”  For example, when Grant went to see Mr. Pichot and the Sheriff at Mr. Pichot’s house, they made him wait for an hour in the kitchen before they would see him. Grant said, “I hope I don’t have to hang around here all day” (155). This is just a vivid example which Gaines was trying to explain that whites still view Grant just as a black man regardless of his education. Moreover, Grant did not receive an equal salary as the white teachers. The novel unveils how poor Grant was that he did not even have money of his own to buy the radio for Jefferson, instead he had to borrow money. Grant said, “I wish I had money on me... I thought I would borrow money from Vivian…” (172). This statement shows that Grant was still economically deprived in the south. Peter Irons said, “The monthly salary of black teachers in the south in 1930 was about 60 percent of the white average, $73 for blacks and $118 for whites” (Par 11). This also proved the theme of injustice in the book was not fiction, but an actual fact which black teachers were experiencing.</i> <br>
	<i class="par">Finally, the injustice and racism described in the book was not only limited to Grant and Jefferson, but also extended down to the black communities. For instance, the people in the black communities were very poor because they were entangled as slaves in a new system called sharecropping. As the author illustrates the life of blacks living in plantation quarters, black people lived in massive poverty, they were denied the right to make a decent and fair wage by the white plantation owners. The black schools did not even have a school building, instead they had they had to use a church has a school. They received the hand me down books and supplies from the white schools and received less funding; Grant said, “I don’t have all the books I need...I need more chalk for the black boards; Many of the books I have to use are hand-me-downs from the white schools,” to Dr. Joseph, the school superintendent. However, Dr. Joseph said nothing other than “We’re all in the same shape, Higgins” (57).  Dr. Joseph went on to give negative remarks to Grant after he had inspected the mouth of the black kids and he told Grant to make kid work in the plantations instead.  According to the Virginia Historical Society, “Black schools, therefore, received far less financial support than did white schools. Black schools had fewer books, worse building, and less well-paid teachers” (par 3) wherein the white teachers were well paid and the white schools were well-funded with abundant school suppliers.</i><br>
	<i class="par"> In a nutshell, Jefferson was killed innocently, Grant was treated very unfairly with disrespect and the black communities suffered, and were deprived of achieving economic success for no reason other than the pigmentation of their skin. The book, A Lesson before Dying, is an epic novel because it depicted and described real accounts of the injustice, racism, and the horrific treatment blacks went through in the confederate states.</i><br>

<p align="center">Obama’s Farewell: An Appeal for Peace, Unity, Forgiveness and Love in America</p>
<p class="indent"> On the 10th of January 2017 at McCormick Place Chicago, former president Barrack H. Obama delivered his acclaim farewell address to the nation.  Obama, a great orator of our time took the stage with an overwhelming amount of cheers and applause from the crowd which set a delightful atmosphere for him. Through his intelligent use of Aristotle’s appeals, alliteration, parallelism, epistrophe, anaphora, and ethnocentrism techniques, he delivered a tremendous speech that was more than a farewell address, but an appeal for all Americans to be peaceful, united more than ever, continue fighting for change, and to love one another including immigrates. </p>
<input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="post-11" />

  <p class="read-more-wrap">

<i class="par"> Mr. Obama opened his speech by talking briefly about the well-wishes he received and thanked everyone for the wishes they sent him; by starting with words of appreciation, he was able to get an opened and cheerful mind from the American people since everyone loved people who are appreciative. In the first paragraph of his address, Obama used parallelism “…those conversations are what have kept me honest, and kept me inspired, and kept me going.” By repeating words, he was able to emphasized the point that was trying to make to the nation. He also established his credibility using the ethos appeal by saying, “You made a better President, and a better man” and “So I first came to Chicago when I was in my early 20s. And I was still trying to figure out who I was…And was the neighborhood not far from here where I began with church groups…” (1) Obama was not only trying to state his credibility, but he was also reinforcing and establishing trust, and common ground with his audience. </i><br>
 <span class="read-more-target">
 <i class="par"> Moreover, former president Obama, appeal to the audience not to ever take for granted the rights they are enjoying and to always fight for those and defend those rights by referring to the fundamental beliefs of the Founding fathers in the Declaration of Independence “…endowed by our creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It’s the insistence that these rights, while self-evident, have never been self-executing” He made that statement to elucidate the audience that while all those rights were promised, but they have never come cheap or establishing themselves except when people stood up firm and fought for them. Throughout his speech, Obama used alliteration such as “… sights were sight too high” …Selma to stonewall” (2) to reinforced and emphasized his message to the audience as well as to strengthen his voice. He also used logos to remind the American people that race is still existing in the society “Race remains a potent and often a divisive force in our society,” though he said that race is still wielding in the society, he also used logic to keep his audience calm and not to be fearful by saying “Now I’ve lived long enough to know that race relations are better than they were 10 or 20 or 30 years ago, no matter what some folks say.” (5) The two statement seem to contradict, but he was able to use them well through antithesis techniques by arranging them in a parallel way.  In addition, Obama also used logical statements such as “Our Founder argued, they quarreled, eventually they compromised. They expected us to do the same” (4) to appeal to the American people to forgive one and another regardless of the disputes or political differences, and live together in harmony for the furtherance of the nation as a whole. By diving into the history of the Founding fathers, he was able to gain authority as well to depicted and showcase a clear picture of his message to the American people.</i> <br>
	<i class="par">The former president also used ethnocentrism, the feeling of superiority of one’s nation over others, such as “We have everything we need to meet those challenges. After all, we remain the wealthiest, most powerful, and most respected nation on earth” (3) to stir up the emotion of Americans and to make them feel proud as American, to have the sense of nationalism. He also used pathos and anaphora throughout his address to pleaded to Americans to love one another and to also have an open mind for all immigrates, and to stop the discrimination and stereotypes most Americans have about immigrates. One way he used to pass on his appeal was by giving a flashback about how early Americans view immigrates “…the stereotypes about immigrates today were said, almost word for word, about the Irish, and Italians, and Poles,” but they were wrong “American wasn't weakened by the presence of these newcomers; these newcomers embraced this nation’s creed, and this nation was strengthened.” (6) He further strengthened his claim not only by giving a flashback of history but he also set himself as a living testimony, a product of an immigrate and the good of immigration. By him setting himself as a product of an immigrate, he was able to persuade his audience to favor immigration and stand up to protect it by all means necessary. In addition, Obama used anaphora to appeal to the nation “…only if our politics better reflects the decency of our people; only if all of us, regardless of party affiliation or particular interest, help restore the sense of common purpose that we badly need right now” (4) to preached unity to the American people regardless of political affiliation. </i><br>
	<i class="par"> Through Aristotle’s appeals, alliteration, ethnocentrism, parallelism, anaphora, and epistrophe techniques, former president Barrack Obama delivered his farewell address to the nation successfully. The speech which he delivered was not just a farewell speech, but a speech of hope, love, unity, and peace. His good work as a president of the United States of America and his farewell message will be forever remembered for generation to come</i><br>
